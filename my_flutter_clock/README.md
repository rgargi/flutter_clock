## Flutter Clock

This is a modified version of section_clock repository.

This is a simple clock featuring a bar on the bottom which shows how much of the hour has passed. The border color and the bar color change according to the weather.

Every hour this transitions to a widget which shows the current day, time, and location and a string cobbled together with some random words. I thought it would be fun to see what these anthropomorphised creatures are doing every hour! I added a little animated character using rive/flare. It came out quite cute considering that it was my first attempt at animating anything from scratch.
